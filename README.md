Internet Controlled Door Lock

This is a hardware hackathon project done for Mudd Hacks
Team Members: Nathan Miller, Eric Mueller, Rohan Nagpal, and Vai Viswanathan

This is the code for an internet controlled door lock. To communicate with 
the lock, you access the website hosted on a Raspberry Pi. The website then executes 
a Python script which communicates with an Arduino which then uses a servo to adjust
the lock on the door as necessary.
